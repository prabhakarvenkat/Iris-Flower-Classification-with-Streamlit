## 📌 Description:
This project is a part of the CS50x Final Project. This project is an interactive machine learning web application developed as part of the CS50x final project. Built using Python and Streamlit, the app performs real-time classification of iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It uses the well-known Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 flower samples.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning in a user-friendly interface. The app allows users to input custom flower measurements through a clean sidebar form and receive instant predictions using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model trained on the dataset. It also includes detailed data visualizations like pairplots using Seaborn and displays statistical summaries to provide insights into the dataset.

In addition to classification, the app evaluates model performance using accuracy and a classification report, all within the Streamlit interface. This project showcases how simple tools can be combined to build and deploy ML models effectively, bridging the gap between backend machine learning workflows and accessible frontend interfaces for end users. It serves as a strong foundation for anyone exploring ML deployment and data science visualization.
